Alexander Mandl, Johanna Barzen, Frank Leymann, Daniel Vietz. On Reducing the Amount of Samples Required for Training of QNNs: Constraints on the Linear Structure of the Training Data. [arXiv:2309.13711 [quant-ph]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13711)

Experiments:
- avg_rank_exp.py: Experiments for training QNNs using training data of varying Schmidt rank
- nlihx_exp.py: Experiments for training QNNs using linearly dependent (in $\mathcal{H}_X$) data
- ortho_exp.py: Experiments for training QNNs using orthogonal training data
	
Visualisation/Analysis of data (``plots.py``):
- Generates plots for above experiments
	+ either from the data in ``experimental_results`` or from the processed results (see Data)
	+ processes results to extract information from raw data in ``experimental_results`` (to change behavior see the function calls at the end of ``plots.py``)
	
The data is available for download at [DaRUS](https://doi.org/10.18419/darus-3442).
